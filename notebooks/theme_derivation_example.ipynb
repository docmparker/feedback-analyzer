    "Here the goal is to derive the main themes of the comments, where a theme is some common feedback expressed by multiple students. This is a good starting point when you're trying to answer the question: \"What did students say about the course?\" at a high level before diving into specifics. This could equally well be applied to user feedback surveys - there isn't much about the analysis that is specific to education. \n",
